### About me
 The purpose of my training is to acquire skills, knowledge and experience for
 working in the field of program development. The meaning of this life is to 
 learn as much as possible about this world. It takes a lot of time and money.
 To travel and develop, remote work suits me. And since I like programming, 
 I decided to combine business with pleasure. I am ready to study hard, work 
 overtime to achieve the desired result.
